3. ** Verify Server and Client - Side Code Separation:**
  Confirm that your server - side and client - side code is appropriately separated.Server Components and Client Components often have different capabilities and restrictions, and code intended for one should not be mixed with the other.

4. ** Check Environment Support:**
  Ensure that the environment where you are running the code supports the use of.Some environments, especially older ones, may not fully support these features.

5. ** Update Dependencies:**
  Ensure that your dependencies and tools are up - to - date.Sometimes, issues like this can be caused by outdated libraries or frameworks.

6. ** Consult Documentation or Community Forums:**
  Check the documentation of the specific framework or library you're using for any information about using  in Client Components. Additionally, explore community forums or discussions related to the framework to see if others have encountered similar issues and find solutions.

Without knowing the specific context of your code and the framework or environment you're working in, these are general guidelines. If the issue persists or if you can provide more details, I may be able to offer more targeted assistance.`
